# lightyear_avian3d 0.28: rollback restore assumes EnlargedAabb was rolled back — false for child colliders

**Target:** lightyear_avian3d 0.28 · **Severity for us:** MEDIUM (moot after the ApplyPosToTransform fix; latent) · **Status:** unfiled

## Suggested title

restore_collider_tree_from_enlarged_aabbs rebuilds the BVH from un-restored child-collider AABBs

## Mechanism

`rollback_resources: true` rolls back `ContactGraph`/`ConstraintGraph`/`PhysicsIslands` and
rebuilds the collider BVH via `restore_collider_tree_from_enlarged_aabbs` +
`repair_missing_contact_pairs_from_restored_aabbs` (lightyear_avian3d-0.28.0/src/plugin.rs:
355-570). The restore's own comment says "The rollback just restored EnlargedAabb" — but
`prepare_rollback` only restores components carrying `PredictionHistory`, which is only attached
to Predicted/PreSpawned/etc. entities (lightyear_prediction-0.28.0/src/predicted_history.rs:
237-267). CHILD COLLIDERS (plain local children of the predicted root) have no history: their
`ColliderAabb`/`EnlargedAabb` — and hence the rebuilt tree leaves and the repair's pair
intersection — keep the abandoned (mispredicted) timeline's values through the restore. The
repair can therefore never resurrect a pair the abandoned timeline lost for AABB-disjointness,
which is exactly how such pairs die.

Additionally the restore path calls `set_proxy_aabb` + `refit_all` (plugin.rs:427-444) without
the `init_primitives_to_nodes_if_uninit` guard avian's native update paths use
(avian3d-0.7.0/src/collider_tree/update.rs:811, 941).

## Measured

Instrumented at tick level (SPIKE_CONTACT_PROBE): tree leaves and moved-set faithfully track the
(wrong, un-restored) component AABBs; contact re-forms at k=1 in 62/69 rollbacks where the
abandoned timeline still had the pair vs fails in 80/85 where it didn't. NOTE: in our codebase
the visible symptom was dominated by the ApplyPosToTransform poisoning (separate report) — with
that fixed, avian's per-tick AABB refresh self-heals this within a tick, so for us it is latent,
not damaging. It remains logically wrong upstream and will bite layouts where child-collider
poses genuinely diverge during prediction.

## Suggested upstream fix

Derive child-collider AABBs from the restored ROOT pose during restore (recompute child collider
Position/AABB from the rolled-back parent instead of trusting non-existent histories), and add
the init guard before `set_proxy_aabb`.

## Our workaround

None needed post-33cc4e4; documenting for upstream correctness. If it ever resurfaces, the
probe (`SPIKE_CONTACT_PROBE=1`) discriminates it in one run.

## What fixing this unlocks for us

**Nothing for us today — filed for the ecosystem.** No workaround exists to delete, no cost to recover,
no capability gated on it. With the `ApplyPosToTransform` poisoning excised
([lightyear-avian-blanket-apply-pos-to-transform.md](lightyear-avian-blanket-apply-pos-to-transform.md))
our child-collider poses are honest, avian's per-tick AABB refresh self-heals the stale leaves within a
tick, and the defect is latent rather than damaging.

The one forward-looking caveat, stated as a caveat and not a payoff: it goes live again the moment a
child collider's pose can genuinely *diverge* from its root during prediction — an articulated track
model with its own bodies, or any collider whose local transform stops being an authored constant. If
that lands and contact starts behaving strangely after rollbacks, this is the first suspect and
`SPIKE_CONTACT_PROBE=1` discriminates it in one run. Until then: no payoff, and we should not pretend
otherwise when filing.
