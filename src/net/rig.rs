//! The networked tank-rig lifecycle: spawning a replicated tank's local sim body and arming the
//! predicted root's render smoothing. Since phase 1 of the sim/view split the body is built
//! SYNCHRONOUSLY from extracted data (`tank::spawn_tank_sim`) the moment the replicated root is
//! usable — colliders, servo frames, `Rig`, `TankSim`, all in one command flush; the glb scene
//! attaches later as pure view. Invariants this module maintains:
//!   1. the sim body attaches only to a valid replicated pose — never to avian's require-inserted
//!      placeholder (`attach_replicated_rig`'s pose gate, the cold-start crash fix);
//!   2. a `RigidBody` is set in the SAME command-flush as the collider inserts — colliders never
//!      wait, unattached or placeholder-posed, for a body that arrives in a later frame (the NaN
//!      ordering class: the step-8 8/8 crash was collider ATTACHMENT/first-propagation racing the
//!      body transition). The server spawns `Dynamic` (always the authority); the client attaches
//!      `Dynamic` if the replicated root is already `Predicted` and `Static` otherwise — an
//!      interpolated remote, whose pose replication owns for good, OR a predicted root whose
//!      `Predicted` marker has not yet replicated. That last case is promoted to `Dynamic` by
//!      `upgrade_predicted_to_dynamic` — a body-TYPE change on a long-prepared body whose
//!      `ColliderTransform`s have had frames of `Prepare` propagation, which is outside the
//!      ordering class (and re-arms invariant 3 regardless);
//!   3. no rollback replays the entity before the end of its first full physics tick under its
//!      current body role (`DisableRollback`, lifted by `enable_rollback_after_first_tick`) —
//!      armed at spawn for the children's first `ColliderTransform` propagation, and re-armed by
//!      the `Static`→`Dynamic` promotion so a freshly-integrating body is never first stepped
//!      inside another entity's replay.
//!
//! The rig's CHILDREN are not rollback participants at all: every carried child state lives
//! root-resident in `tank::TankSim` (one `local_rollback` on the predicted root), and child
//! transforms are derived from it each tick — which is what retired the whole
//! `DeterministicPredicted` decoration / pose-history-stripping / despawn-grace machinery this
//! module used to maintain (steps 7–8's hazard cluster).
