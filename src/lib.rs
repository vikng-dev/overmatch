// Two clippy lints fight Bevy's ECS paradigm and are allowed crate-wide (as Bevy's own codebase
// does): `type_complexity` fires on ordinary multi-component query tuples, and `too_many_arguments`
// on systems that legitimately need many params. We de-duplicate the genuinely-repeated query shapes
// behind named `QueryData`/`SystemParam` (e.g. `damage::VolumeFacets`, `damage::ControlledTank`);
// what remains is irreducible ECS shape, not a smell.
