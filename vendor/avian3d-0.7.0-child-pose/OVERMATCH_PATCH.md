# Overmatch avian3d patch

This directory is the published `avian3d` 0.7.0 crate (extracted from the `.crate` whose sha256
matches `Cargo.lock`) with the source change below, tagged `OVERMATCH PATCH` so the diff against
pristine 0.7.0 is self-describing. (`Cargo.lock` from the published crate is omitted; it is not read
for a path dependency.)

## Child-collider pose writes (`src/collision/collider/collider_transform/plugin.rs`)

`update_child_collider_position` (`PhysicsStepSystems::First`, every physics step) assigned every
child collider's `Position` and `Rotation` through `Mut`, whether or not the value changed. Every
child collider of every rigid body, static bodies included, was therefore marked changed every
step, and `update_moved_collider_aabbs` (`src/collider_tree/update.rs`), which skips a collider
whose `Position`, `Rotation` and shape are unchanged since the last physics tick, recomputed every
one of their AABBs every step. On the product map that is every building element and tree segment,
none of which moves.

The patch computes the same pose with the same expressions and assigns `Position` and `Rotation`
only where the new value differs in bits (`f32::to_bits` per component, so `-0.0` against `0.0`
and NaN payloads count as different). The stored values are bit-identical to the unpatched
system's; only the change ticks of unchanged values differ.

Who reads those change ticks: in this crate, `update_moved_collider_aabbs` (above, a pure function
of pose and shape: skipping it for an unchanged pose leaves the same AABB), `wake_on_changed`
(rigid bodies only; the query excludes `RigidBody`) and `position_to_transform` (rigid bodies and
`ApplyPosToTransform` only). `lightyear_avian3d` has the same system, patched the same way
(`vendor/lightyear_avian3d-0.30.1-child-pose`); without both patches the change ticks still fire.

The defect and the proposed upstream fix are recorded in `upstream/avian-child-collider-pose-churn.md`.
